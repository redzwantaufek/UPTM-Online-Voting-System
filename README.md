# UPTM-Online-Voting-System

This new system is intended to replace the old UPTM voting system. The new system will have more new and relevant features. The first feature is it will provide detailed information about the election candidates, including their name, picture, short biodata, and campaign materials like videos and posters. Students will find it easier to choose their preferred candidates for their MPP. The next new feature is that administrators and students can access real-time analytics related to the election, including voter turnout and other analysis. Additionally, the system will incorporate more components, such as user profiles, election information, and candidates' details. Users will also have access to the history of past elections. This system will be used by students for the election and by Student Development & Campus Lifestyle (HEP) staff to manage the system administration. Furthermore, it is a dynamic website that ensures seamless access from any device, whether it is a smartphone or a computer. The UPTM Online Voting System strives to close this gap by offering a creative and comprehensive solution to the university community's voting procedures.
